This page will ultimately link directly to an embedded viewer for the high-resolution manuscript images.

In the meantime, images of the Bannatyne can be viewed via [Universal Viewer](http://universalviewer.io).

Simply copy and paste the [IIIF manifest](https://view.nls.uk/manifest/7446/74466548/manifest.json) into the 'View an IIIF Manifest' field.
